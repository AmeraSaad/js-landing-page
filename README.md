# Landing Page - DOM Manipulation Project

This project demonstrates DOM manipulation by dynamically generating a navigation bar, smoothly scrolling to page sections, and highlighting sections as they come into view. 

# Quickstart/Demo
Clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the landing page in action. The navigation is built using JavaScript, and the page layout adapts based on section visibility.
